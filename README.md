# Dotify by Ashmann Syngle

This app shows a list of songs (with artists and cover photos) with a small mini player view. The user can click on a song to change the current song (in the mini player). The user can press 'Shuffle' to shuffle the songs in the list. They can also long press a song to delete it. On clicking the mini player, the user sees a screen which shows all information about the song as well as interact with the media buttons (play, previous, next).
